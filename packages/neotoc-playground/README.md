# Neotoc Playground

`neotoc-playground` is a CLI tool to generate random dummy content in a basic HTML, CSS, and JS setup for experimenting with Neotoc locally.

From your terminal, run one of the following commands based on your preference and follow the prompts.

```sh
npx neotoc-playground
pnpx neotoc-playground
yarn dlx neotoc-playground
bunx neotoc-playground
```

**Info**: `npx`, `pnpx`, `yarn dlx` or `bunx` are commands from `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `bun`, respectively. They let you fetch an npm package from the registry without installing it to your project or globally and run the default command binary it exposesâ€”perfect for our use case.

It will create a neotoc playground with randomly generated dummy content based on your input. Then run the dev server with the command it prints to open it in your browser.

To see the other ways you can create a neotoc playgroud or to learn to remake the dummy content possibly with different preferences run the following to see instructions:

```sh
npx neotoc-playground --help
```

Mess around and have fun!
