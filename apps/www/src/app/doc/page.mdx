Neotoc creates a TOC(Table of Contents) UI by parsing the DOM inside the browser.

The TOC you see on the right is made with neotoc. It's main features are:

- __Fluid highlight of the view__ and __auto scrolling of TOC__.
- Both __manual__ and __auto folding__ support.
- __Easily stylable__ with dozens of CSS variables.
- __TypeScript support__.
- __Accessible__.
- __Zero dependency__.
- __Performant__ and __Lightweight__.
- __Framework agnostic__. You can use it in vanilla HTML CSS JS setup to framework like Next.js. This is doc is made with Next.js.

## Appetizer ðŸ˜‹

Here are some controllers I made for you to easily experience its customizability:

- <RelativeFontSizeSlider />
- <IndentLineGapSlider />
- Turn on/off Auto folding: <AutoFoldSwitch />
- Turn on/off ellipsis for long headings: <EllipsisSwitch />

There are many many more things that you can do. But that's for the rest of this doc. I hope you are now as excited to try it out as I'm to share it with you.

## Quick start guide: _It is just three lines away_

Here I'm writing this quick start guide in the context of Vite's `vanilla` template for simplicity.

So after setting up your project, install `neotoc`(with the package manager you are using. I'm using `pnpm` here cause its my favorite):

```sh
pnpm add neotoc
```

Now in your JavaScript file do the following `import`s and call `neotoc` like below:

```js
import neotoc from "neotoc";
import "./neotoc.css";

neotoc({ io: "article >> h* >> aside" });
```

Neotoc doesn't ship any CSS with the package to allow you to style it freely. However you don't have to write it from scratch. I've already written the CSS I find appealing. So copy it form Github and paste it in `neotoc.css`(or whatever filename you choose) and tweak it as you like it.

Now to create TOC, we must call `neotoc` with the `io`(i.e. input output) option. Here you have to give the answer of three questions in the form of _CSS selectors_ seperated by `>>`:
1. ___Where should it look for headings?___
    - Here it is the `article` element.
2. ___Which headings should it consider for creating the TOC?___
    - Here it is `h*`, which means headings of all levels.(Though it's not a valid CSS selector, it's special shortcut that is allowed here).
3. ___Where should it append the the created TOC?___
    - Here it is the `aside` element.

If you didn't have `article`, heading elements in it and `aside`, create them in your HTML. And make sure those headings have unique ids. Then you should see the TOC in the `aside` element.

Note that to get things work nicely Neotoc expect two things:
- Heading that you look for must have ids.
- And those headings should appear in a sensible order. By sensible order, I mean:
  - First found heading's level is considered the largest one. So if you choose `<h2>` as your first heading, you must not use the `<h1>` heading later.
  - There must be no gap between two heading levels when going top to bottom. So, after `<h2>` you should not use the heading `<h4>`.

Now you have good a foundational knowledge about it. Let's now dive into its API.

## Neotoc API

`neotoc` package only has a default export. It's the function that you call to create the toc. Here we will name this function as `neotoc` too:

```js
import neotoc from "neotoc";
```

`neotoc` takes a options object and returns a cleaup function.

If you are using `neotoc` in React or other library/framework, you will probably need to call or return this function where it is needed. For React for example, the pattern is like below:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const removeNeotoc = neotoc({
    io: "article >> h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 >> aside"
  });

  return () => {
    removeNeotoc();
  };
}, []);
```

In you have a vanilla HTML CSS JS setup you usually don't need use the cleanup function.

Now, let's see all of its options in detail.

### Options

#### `io`

This is the only required option.
