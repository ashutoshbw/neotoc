# Neotoc—Table of Contents Reimagined

By [Ashutosh Biswas](https://github.com/ashutoshbw)

Welcome! On mobile, tap the bottom-right button to open the TOC. On desktop, you’ll see it right away. Scroll around, fold/unfold, and give it a try if you haven’t already—pretty cool, right?

Let's get started.

## The playground

Check out this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ashutoshbw/pen/Jojvvbp) for experimenting with it instantly.

To easily experiment with it in the comfort of your favorite code editor and with some extra tooling, I've created a CLI called `create-neotoc`. It scaffolds a Vite-powered Neotoc playground. To get started, run the following command in your terminal (you’ll need Node.js installed on your system):

```sh
npx create-neotoc
```

and follow the prompts to set it up. It will look something like below:

![create neotoc cli](/create-neotoc.png)

Doing `npm run dev` will start a local web server. Open the given URL in a web browser and you will find further instructions there.

The playground is just for experimenting and learning. But if you’d like to start from scratch, feel free to go for it!

## Installation

From npm:

```sh
npm install neotoc@1.0.0
```

You can also use CDNs like jsDelivr to fetch it. For example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/neotoc@1.0.0/dist/index.umd.js" defer></script>
```

It is recommended to use the exact version to avoid any breaking changes.

## Adding styles

Neotoc ships some base styles and color schemes to quickly style it.

### Base styles

Base styles style everything other than colors. You must need to add a base style, otherwise the TOC will look like broken.

Available base styles:

- __Modern__: Rounded corners with some subtle decorative styles.
- __Plain__: No rounded corners and subtle decorative styles.

For example, to load the modern base style from jsDelivr, add the following link tag in the head of your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/neotoc@1.0.0/dist/base-modern.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

To use any other base style replace `modern` with the lowercase version of that base style name.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
Make sure you load styles from the same version of neotoc that you are using to avoid any mismatch.
</Admonition>

If your project setup allows you to import styles in JS/TS files, you can load it like below:

```js
import "neotoc/base-<name-of-the-base-style>.css";
```

For example:

```js
import "neotoc/base-modern.css";
```

### Color schemes

Available color shemes:

- __Zinc__: Based on TailwindCSS's zinc color palette.
- __Slate__: Based on TailwindCSS's slate color palette.
- __Monochrome__: Black and white.

For example, to load the slate color scheme from jsDelivr, add the following link tag in the head of your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/neotoc@1.0.0/dist/colors-slate.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

To use any other colorscheme replace `slate` with lowercase verion of that colorscheme name.

If your project setup allows you to import styles in JS/TS files, you can load it like below:

```js
import "neotoc/colors-<name-of-the-colorscheme>.css";
```

For example:

```js
import "neotoc/colors-slate.css";
```

## Requirements

For Neotoc to work properly, it expects two things:

- The headings you target must have unique IDs.
- The headings must appear in a logical order. By logical order, I mean:
  - The first heading found determines the highest level. For example, if you start with an `<h2>` heading, you should not use an `<h1>` heading later.
  - There should be no gaps between heading levels when progressing from top to bottom. For instance, after an `<h2>`, you should not use an `<h4>` without including an `<h3>` in between.

## Neotoc API

You can import the TOC UI generator function directly from the package as shown below:

```js
import neotoc from "neotoc";
```

You can rename `neotoc` to something else if you wish, as it is the default export.

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
If you load neotoc as an UMD module from a CDN, then the TOC generator function will be available under the `neotoc` variable.
</Admonition>

`neotoc` accepts an options object and returns a cleanup function.

If you're using Neotoc in React or another library/framework, you'll likely need to call or return this function where it is required. If you are working with a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS setup, you typically won't need to use the cleanup function.

Now, let's explore all of its options in detail.

### Options

#### `io` and `to`

Type of `io`: `string`<br/>
Type of `to`: `HTMLElement`

`io` is the ___only required___ option. To create a TOC, you must call `neotoc` with the `io` (input-output) option. Here, you need to answer three questions using CSS selectors separated by `>>`. For example:

```js
neotoc({ io: "article >> h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 >> nav" });
```

1. ___Where should it look for headings?___
    - Here, it's the `<article>` element.
2. ___Which headings should it consider for creating the TOC?___
    - Here, it's all headings from `<h2>` to `<h6>`.
3. ___Where should it append the generated TOC?___
    - Here, it's the `<nav>` element.

The last part of the `io` value can be _omitted_ if you need to provide the corresponding HTML element directly. You can use the `to` option for this purpose.

Note that if the 3rd part of the `io` option is specified, `to` option is ignored.

#### `title`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: `"On this page"`

The title of the TOC UI that appears at the top left of it.

#### `fillAnchor`

Type: `(heading: HTMLHeadingElement) => string | Node`<br />
Default value: `(heading) => heading.textContent`

It is used to determine the content of anchor elements in the TOC. If your headings have a complex structure or contain elements like `<code>` or `<i>`, as seen on this page, and you want to display them in the TOC, this option can be useful.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
You can't have the same node in two places in the DOM. You will need to [clone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode) it.
</Admonition>

#### `ellipsis`

Type: `boolean`<br />
Default value: `false`

If `true`, overflowed text is truncated with ... instead of wrapping to the next line. When you hover over the anchor, the full text is displayed in the browser's default tooltip.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
When using `fillAnchor` with cloned heading nodes containing `<code>` elements, set their position to `static` in the TOC if it's not, to ensure the ellipsis appears correctly.
</Admonition>

#### `classPrefix`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: `nt-`

All CSS classes assigned to elements in the TOC UI are prefixed with `nt-` by default to avoid class name collisions.

If the `nt-` prefix is already used in class names elsewhere on your page, you should set a different value here.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
If you set anything else here, as a side-effect, you can't directly use styles that come with neotoc. You need to copy these styles and replace all occurrences of the default `nt-` prefix with your new class prefix and then use them.
</Admonition>

#### `initialFoldLevel`

Type: `number`<br />
Default value: `6`

It should be a number from `1` to `6`.

If it is `1`, `<h1>` and all lower-level headings' corresponding sections in the TOC will be folded initially.

If it is `2`, `<h2>` and all lower-level headings' corresponding sections in the TOC will be folded initially.

And so on.

Note that if it is `6`, everything is unfolded initially since there is no `<h7>`.

#### `offsetTop` and `offsetBottom`

Type of both: `number`<br />
Unit: `px`<br />
Default value of both: `0`

Neotoc considers the portion of the nearest scroll container(usually the `<html>` element) cropped by the screen as its viewport.

This viewport is reflected in the TOC to highlight the relevant area.

You can lower the top edge of this viewport using the `offsetTop` option and raise the bottom edge of the viewport using `offsetBottom`.

This is useful if you have a fixed header or footer.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note: Nearest scroll container">
Here "nearest scroll container" refers to the nearest scroll container of the element matched by the first part of the `io` option.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip: If you have fixed header...">
If you have a fixed header, to ensure the headings scroll to the correct position, you can use the CSS [`scroll-margin-top`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-top) property on the heading elements.
</Admonition>

#### `autoScrollOffset`

Type: `number`<br />
Unit: `px`<br />
Default value: `50`

This option allows you to control the distance the highlighted area should stay from the top and bottom edges of the main TOC UI (the element that by default has the class `.nt-body`) when possible.

## Customizing color schemes

Changing colors of different parts of the TOC UI is as simple as assigning some color value to the following CSS variables, which are defined on the root TOC UI element (with the default class `nt-widget`):

- `--bg`
- `--fg`
- `--bg-anchor-hover`
- `--bg-anchor-active`
- `--bg-sub-anchors`
- `--bg-header-btn`
- `--bg-header-btn-hover`
- `--bg-header-btn-active`
- `--bg-header-btn-disabled`
- `--fg-header-btn-disabled`
- `--border-header-btn`
- `--bg-toggle-fold-btn-hover`
- `--bg-toggle-fold-btn-active`
- `--indent-line`
- `--indent-line-highlight`
- `--fold-indicator-gradient-mid`
- `--light-bar`
- `--light-bar-tip-on-fold`
- `--light-opacity`

You can change colors responsively using media queries. Additionally, you can define different colors for light and dark modes using CSS selectors.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
If you want to interactively change these variables and see the result on the page, you can use your browser's developer tools.
</Admonition>

For example if you only want the light bar color to orange while keeping rest of your color scheme the same, add the following in a stylesheet that comes after the color scheme stylesheet:

```css
.nt-widget {
  --light-bar: orange;
}
```

If you are not statisfied with changing a color or two, you can even create your own color schemes from scratch in the same way and use it instead of modifying an existing color scheme.

## Customizing the base style

You can modify various aspects of the base style using the following CSS variables:

- `--body-height`
- `--relative-font-size`
- `--toggle-fold-btn-width`
- `--indent-line-gap`
- `--indent-line-width`
- `--anchor-padding-block`
- `--anchor-padding-inline`
- `--anchor-border-radius`
- `--padding-left`
- `--light-bar-width`
- `--light-bar-tip-radius`
- `--light-spread-length`
- `--folding-duration`

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Of these few variables should be in some specific units or types:

- `--relative-font-size`: It should not have any units. Just plain number.
- `--toggle-fold-btn-width`: It should be in `em`.
- `--indent-line-gap`: It should be in `px`.
- `--folding-duration`: It should be of [`<time>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/time) type.

The rest of the variables can be of any [`<length>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) type.
</Admonition>

Of these, `--body-height` is the one you will most likely want to modify. It describes the height of body of the TOC UI that is the area except the header of the TOC UI. The default value of this is `400px`. Suppose you want this height to be something dynamic like `calc(100vh - 5rem)`. Then add the following in a stylesheet that comes after the base stylesheet of your choice:

```css
.nt-widget {
  --body-height: calc(100vh - 5rem);
}
```

If you want to interactively change any of these variables and see the result on the page, you can use your browser's developer tools.
