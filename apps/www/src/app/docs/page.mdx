# Neotoc Docs

Crafting a table of contents can be a real challenge. Making it interactive and sleek? That’s a whole new level of complexity. This is where Neotoc comes in—allowing you to create a highly engaging TOC UI with minimal effort, giving users an experience they’ll truly enjoy.

## Getting started

Getting started with Neotoc depends on your project setup. There are two main ways to use Neotoc:

- If you have a vanilla setup, you can use a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/neotoc).
- If your project uses a bundler, you will most likely want to install it via a package manager (e.g., `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`).

In this guide, I'll cover the getting started section in the context of Vite's `vanilla` template for simplicity. You can easily set one up by running `npm create vite` in your terminal and following the prompts. For more details, refer to [Scaffolding Your First Vite Project](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

After setting up your project, install `neotoc` using the package manager of your choice:

```sh
npm install neotoc
# or
pnpm add neotoc
# or
yarn add neotoc
```

In your JavaScript/TypeScript file(most likely `main.js`/`main.ts`), add the following import statements and call `neotoc` as shown below:

```js
import neotoc from "neotoc";
import "./neotoc.css";

neotoc({ io: "article >> h* >> aside" });
```

Neotoc doesn’t include any CSS by default, giving you complete freedom to style it however you like. That said, you don’t need to start from scratch. You can use the stylesheet I’ve written for this site as a starting point. [Copy it from GitHub](https://github.com/ashutoshbw/neotoc/blob/main/apps/www/src/app/docs/neotoc.css), paste it into `neotoc.css` (or any filename of your choice), and customize it to suit your needs.

To create a TOC, you must call `neotoc` with the `io` (input-output) option. Here, you need to answer three questions using CSS selectors separated by `>>`:

1. ___Where should it look for headings?___
    - In this case, it's the `article` element.
2. ___Which headings should it consider for creating the TOC?___
    - Here, it's `h*`, which means headings of all levels. (Although it's not a valid CSS selector, it's a special shortcut allowed here.)
3. ___Where should it append the created TOC?___
    - Here, it's the `aside` element.

If your HTML does not include an `<article>` element with headings inside it or an `<aside>` element, create them. Ensure the headings have unique IDs. Once these elements are in place, you should see the TOC in the `<aside>` element.

Note that for Neotoc to work properly, it expects two things:

- The headings you target must have unique IDs.
- The headings must appear in a logical order. By logical order, I mean:
  - The first heading found determines the highest level. For example, if you start with an `<h2>` heading, you should not use an `<h1>` heading later.
  - There should be no gaps between heading levels when progressing from top to bottom. For instance, after an `<h2>`, you should not use an `<h4>` without including an `<h3>` in between.

That's everything you need to know to get started with Neotoc.

## Neotoc API

`neotoc` package only has a default export. It's the function that you call to create the toc. Here we will name this function as `neotoc` too:

```js
import neotoc from "neotoc";
```

`neotoc` takes a options object and returns a cleaup function.

If you are using `neotoc` in React or other library/framework, you will probably need to call or return this function where it is needed. For React for example, the pattern is like below:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const removeNeotoc = neotoc({
    io: "article >> h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 >> aside"
  });

  return () => {
    removeNeotoc();
  };
}, []);
```

In you have a vanilla HTML CSS JS setup you usually don't need use the cleanup function.

Now, let's see all of its options in detail.

### Options

#### `io` and `to`

Type of `io`: `string`<br/>
Type of `to`: `HTMLElement`

`io` is the ___only required___ option. We have already covered it mostly in the [Quick Start guide](#quick-start-guide-it-is-just-three-lines-away). Let's cover the rest here.

The last part of the `io` can be ommitted if there is a need to provide the corresponding HTML element directly. We can use the `to` option for that purpose.

One use case of `to` option is that it allows you to easily create a wrapper component for it in React:

```tsx
function Neotoc({
  from,
  className,
}: {
  from: string;
  className?: string;
}) {
  const toRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    return neotoc({ io: `${from} >> h*`, to: toRef.current! });
  }, [from]);
  return <div ref={toRef} className={className}></div>;
}
```

Note that if the 3rd part of the `io` option is specified, `to` option is ignored.

#### `title`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: `"On this page"`

The title of the toc UI that appears on the top left of it.

#### `fillAnchor`

Type: `(heading: HTMLHeadingElement) => string | Node`<br />
Default value: `(heading) => heading.textContent`

It is used to determine the content of anchors elements in the toc. If your headings have complex structure or contain elements like `<code>` or `<i>`  like in this doc and you want to show them in the toc, this option can be useful.

__Tip__: You can't have the same node in two places in the DOM. You will need to [clone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode) it.

#### `ellipsis`

Type: `boolean`<br />
Default value: `false`

If `true`, long heading's text is truncated with ... instead of wrapping it to the next line. If you hover of the anchor the full text is shown in the browser default tooltip.

__Tip__: If you clone nodes of your headings to populate the content of anchors in the toc using [`fillAnchor`](#fillanchor) and if your headings have `<code>` elements, make sure their position is `static` when then are in the toc, otherwise ellipsis may not appear next to them.

#### `classPrefix`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: `nt-`

All the CSS classes assigned to different elements in the toc UI are by default prefixed with `nt-` as an attempt to avoid class name collision.

This the `nt-` prefix is already used in class names of other elements of your page, you should set a different value here. And in your CSS for neotoc, you will also have to replace all occurances of `nt-` with your chosen prefix.

#### `initialFoldLevel`

Type: `number`<br />
Default value: `6`

It should be a number from `1` to `6`.

If it is `1`, `<h1>` and all lower level heading's corresponding sections in the toc will be folded initially.

If it is `2`, `<h2>` and all lower level heading's corresponding sections in the toc will be folded initially.

And so on.

Note that if it is `6` everything is unfolded initially since there is no `<h7>`.

#### `offsetTop` and `offsetBottom`

Type of both: `number`<br />
Unit: `px`<br />
Default value of both: `0`

Neotoc considers the nearest scroll container's(usually it is the `<html>` element) visible portion on the screen as its viewport. 

This viewport is reflected in the toc to show highlighted area.

These two options allow you to lower the top of edge of the viewport using the `offsetTop` option and raise the bottom edge of the viewport using `offsetBottom`.

This is useful if you have fixed header or footer.

__Note__: In this doc, by nearest scroll container, it is meant the nearest scroll container of the element that is matched by the first part of the `io` option.

#### `autoFold`

Type: `boolean`<br />
Default value: `false`

Whether or not to auto fold/unfold the toc based on the what is in view.

#### `autoScroll`

Type: `boolean`<br />
Default value: `true`

Whether or not to automatically scroll the toc to have the highlighted portion in view when the nearest scroll container is scrolled.

#### `autoScrollOffset`

Type: `number`<br />
Unit: `px`<br />
Default value: `50`

When auto scroll is on, with this you can control the distance the highlighted area should stay away from the top and bottom edge of the toc UI(the element which by default gets the class `.nt-body`) when it can.

#### `toggleFoldIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Chevron down icon(SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/charm/chevron-down/)

This icon is shown at the left of each anchor text on the toc which has sub anchors underneath it to allow you to fold/unfold it. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

#### `unfoldableIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Dot icon(SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/lucide/dot/)

This icon is shown at the left of each anchor text on the toc which do not have sub anchors underneath it. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

#### `foldIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Unfold less rounded icon(SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/material-symbols/unfold-less-rounded/)

This is used on the fold button on the header of the toc. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

#### `unfoldIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Unfold more rounded icon(SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/material-symbols/unfold-more-rounded/)

This is used on the unfold button on the header of the toc. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

#### `foldAllIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Unfold less double rounded icon(SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/material-symbols/unfold-less-double-rounded/)

This is used on the fold all button on the header of the toc. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

#### `unfoldAllIcon`

Type: `string`<br />
Default value: [Unfold more double rounded icon (SVG)](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/material-symbols/unfold-more-double-rounded/)

This is used on the unfold all button on the header of the toc. You can set another SVG icon here with this option.

## Theming 🎨

I recommend you to [copy the style for the toc](https://github.com/ashutoshbw/neotoc/blob/main/apps/www/src/components/toc/neotoc.css) that ou see on the right, and modify it based on your need because this is the style that I always try to keep updated and polished as much as I can.

The goal of this section is to make yourself familiar with this stylesheet. It will not be a exhaustive overview. I will only include things that you most likely want to modify.

The stylesheet has two main parts:
- __`SETTINGS`__: Things that you will usually want to modify, like colors, and size of stuffs and folding duration.
- __`NEOtoc STYLE`__: Styles that define the structure of the toc and subtle details.

Here I will mainly discuss about the `SETTINGS` part. I'm leaving the rest of the CSS file for you to explore and understand according to your need.

Let's start with light/dark theme.

### Light/dark mode colors

You have to use CSS variables(aka custom properties) for this. The default class name for the toc widget is `.nt-widget`. You should declare colors for light/dark theme via CSS variables here. In the stylesheet it's done like below:

```css
:root.light .nt-widget {
  /* light mode color definitions */
}
:root.dark .nt-widget {
  /* dark mode color definitions */
}

/* styles for medium sized screen and above */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  :root.light .nt-widget {
  }
  :root.dark .nt-widget {
  }
}
```

Note it's done in a mobile first approach. Here light/dark theme is determined by whether the `.light` or `.dark` class is present on `<html>` element. Here change the selector to match how you differenciate light/dark theme for your website.

The CSS variable names are descriptive and I hope you will easily figure out where they relate to.

I defined the colors in [HSL](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/hsl-colors-css/) because, it's very easy to tweak them. But you can use any other color format of your preference.

Now let's move on to the sizing of stuffs.


You have the following color related CSS variables at your disposal. Hover over the variable names to highlight relevant part in the toc on the left in <span className="green-sample-color">green</span>. (Note that states like `hover`, `active`, `disabled` are ignored in highlighting to help you see the things it can ___possibly___ target. When you set color values to such variables they are only applied in the corresponding state.)

- `--bg`: Applies background color all the elements that are highlighted when you hover over the variable name on the left.
- `--fg`: Applies text and icon color.
- `--bg-anchor-hover`: Anchor's background color in hover state.
- `--bg-anchor-active`: Anchor's background color in active state.
- `--bg-sub-anchors`: To see the highlight you will need to unfold/expand a section in the toc.
- `--bg-header-btn`
- `--bg-header-btn-hover`
- `--bg-header-btn-active`
- `--bg-header-btn-disabled`
- `--fg-header-btn-disabled`
- `--border-header-btn`
- `--bg-toggle-fold-btn-hover`
- `--bg-toggle-fold-btn-active`
- `--indent-line`: Note that it applies color to actually a border.
- `--indent-line-highlight`: It applies when you over of the parent toggle fold button.
- `--fold-indicator-gradient-mid`: To see it, fold a section in the toc.
- `--light-bar`
- `--light-bar-tip-on-fold`
- `--light-opacity`

### Sizing and Timing

Here again, we use CSS variables in the `.nt-widget` class(by default) to define these things. The variables are:

- `--height`
- `--header-height`
- `--relative-font-size`
- `--toggle-fold-btn-width`
- `--indent-line-gap`
- `--indent-line-width`
- `--anchor-padding-block`
- `--anchor-padding-inline`
- `--anchor-border-radius`
- `--padding-left`
- `--light-bar-width`
- `--light-bar-tip-radius`
- `--light-spread-length`
- `--folding-duration`

#### `--height`

It describes the total height of the toc widget(the element having the class `.nt-widget` by default). (Actually it's the maximum height. But you can change easily if you want. We well see that in the next section.)

I've written it's value tailored for this website(i.e. with the help of external CSS variables). You can use any length value for the height as your need.

Note that toc widget is composed of two things:

- Header of the toc (having the title and fold buttons). It has the class `nt-header` by default.
- Body of the toc. It has the class `nt-body` by default.

#### `--header-height`

I use a fixed height for this, which makes it possible to use `--height` to determine to full height of the toc widget:

```css
/* This is in the FOUNDATION section */
.nt-body {
  max-height: calc(var(--height) - var(--header-height));
}
```

If you need want it be exact height, just use `height` instead of `max-height`.
